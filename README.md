# Retail-Sales-Forecasting
<div style="background-color: #F9F9F9; padding: 20px; border-radius: 5px;"> <p>Walmart is one of the largest global retail corporations, operating a vast network of hypermarkets. This dataset, provided by Walmart, includes information from 45 different stores across the United States. It contains weekly sales data, with additional details such as store size, location, and promotional activities. Furthermore, the dataset indicates whether the week corresponds to a major holiday, such as Christmas, Thanksgiving, Super Bowl, and Labor Day.</p> <h2 style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; text-align: left;">Business Objectives:</h2> <p>The primary goal of this analysis is to predict the weekly sales for each Walmart store. The dataset features both time-based factors (like the week of the year) and store-specific features (such as store size and location), which may influence sales. Additionally, a critical focus is to determine how major holidays impact sales. Specifically, we aim to analyze how sales fluctuate during holiday weeks compared to non-holiday weeks and how these fluctuations vary across different stores.</p> </div>
