# üìö Walmart Sales Prediction Model

## üìñ Overview
Walmart is one of the largest global retail chains with a vast network of hypermarkets. This project leverages sales data from 45 Walmart stores across the U.S., including weekly sales, store size, location, and information about major holidays such as Christmas, Thanksgiving, Super Bowl, and Labor Day.

The goal of this project is to predict weekly sales for Walmart stores by analyzing time-based factors (such as the week of the year) and store-specific features. The analysis also focuses on understanding the impact of holidays on sales and how factors like store size and location influence sales performance.
